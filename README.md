# TasklyAugust
### Problem Statement
Individuals often have a collection of tasks in a day that they must complete. Unfortunately, these tasks can seem overwhelming to serial procrastinators and people who suffer from mental illness. Individuals who have formed bad habits also find it hard to complete tasks. From initial surveying, when people plan out tasks for a day they encounter the following problems:
* Poor task time estimation (Severely under or overestimate the amount of time tasks will take)
* Completion Fallacy (All tasks must be completed in one go)
* Overbooking (A collection of tasks are assigned to a day that is not realistic to complete)
* No rest or down time incorporated in (Humans are not made to be productive 100% of the time and forcing high productivity can lead to burn out.)

### Audience
* Smartphone Users
* Young Adults (College Age / Early Career)
* The mentally Ill
* Procrastinators
* Our target audience is young adults (college age / early career) that are just starting to experience independence.

### User Testing Statement

Hello, and thank you for taking time out of your day to test the UI/UX design of a new app in development named Taskly, an app designed to help users organize tasks in their day. During this user testing session you will be provided with a series of tasks to complete to the best of your ability. Please keep in mind that this is NOT a test of your technological prowess, but rather a test of the design of the application presented to you today. Please feel free to talk through all steps you take to complete a task. Any and all criticism is welcome, critique will be understood to be about the app presented and not a reflection of technical capability of the development team. Any and all notes taken will be anonymized and are about the app performance. Thank you again for your willingness to partake in this study; if there are no objections, we shall begin.
